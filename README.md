# Cyclistic Case Study

Cyclistic is a bike sharing company located in Chicago. The director of marketing for Cyclistic believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. The marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.
